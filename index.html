	<div>This domain is owned by a <span>Philosopher</span>. He thought he liked this domain when he leashed it, until recently when he searched the words "Red Hooded Ninja" on many search engines only to find that it is associated with PORN. So, please go to <a href="http://futureweb.ninja">Future Web Ninja</a> instead. You might find it broken for now but he is trying to construct an adorable website for that domain. Thank you.</div>
