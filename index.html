	<div>This domain is owned by a <span>PHILOSOPHER</span>. He thought he liked this domain when he leashed it, until recently when he searched the words "Red Hooded Ninja" on many search engines only to find that it is associated with PORN. Because of this unfortunate event, he decided to be a <span><a href="http://futureweb.ninja">FUTURE WEB NINJA</a></span> instead. You might find it broken for now but he is trying to construct an adorable website for that domain. Thank you.</div>

agent: MarkPCVG_12345
caller:
security: Y/N
Issue:
Actions Taken:

Greeting:
Thank you for calling time warner cable, My name is calvin, How may I help you today?

Build Rapport:
Oh, Internet is important for me too and I understand how it feels to lose it.
I see, I completely understand you do not want to troubleshoot however we could get your issue resolved today. Do you mind if we give this a quick try over the phone?
Can I have your name please?
Alright then, first I need to pull up your account in order for me to run some diagnostics on your modem. So, can I please have the phone number associated to the account?



Verification:
I now have the account pulled up. For verification purposes, can I have your pin please?

Oh ok, how about the last 4 digits of your social security.

Set Expectation:

Here's what I will do, let me go ahead and check if this is caused by an outage. However if this is not caused by an outage, I can definitely schedule a technician to come
to your house within this week.

I did the core checks and there is no outage in your area right now. I will now go ahead and schedule a technician for you.

Is your home number a good call back number for the technician to use?
Quick reminder, there should be someone in your home who is at least 18 years and above and who speaks english when the technician arrives.

Just for the heads up, if we send a tech immediately and they found out that it's not a TWC issue you might be charged for the trip.
For example ___ if it is a misuse or a customer error. Rest assured if it is a TWC error, like a defective equipment, the charge will be waved.

Resolution:
Good news! I was able to schedule an appointment  I will be sending a technician tom July 31, 2015 4-5p. I'll make sure that the technician arrive on time, they are experts on what they do and help you resolved
 whatever concerns that you have regarding your internet connection.

Do you have any special instructions for the technician?

Recap:
Ms. Smith, Just to do a quick recap, you called to request a technician because you already did the troubleshooting steps with the other representative, 
I performed the core checks on your account and I placed a work order for a technician at the soonest possible time.

Sales:
Ms Smith, since I already have you on the phone and I can see that you currently have the standard package, we currently have a good deal right now that for 
only an additional $10 you will be able to upgrade your internet speed to a turbo package. Which will actually give you a better internet speed


Proactive:
So Ms Smith, In case you encounter connection issues in the future, it's possible for you 
to check the status of your modem or if there's an outage in your area, you can even
resched the tech appointment through MyAccount in the TWC website or by using the TWC
app on your phone.

Alright then, is there anything else I can help you with?
